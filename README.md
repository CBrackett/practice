# practice

Goal: To build a simple application in java, python, and go and have automated deployments to AWS, GCP, and Azure. The application will provide resume and profile information about me, Chris Brackett, in the form of both REST and GraphQL APIs. A front-end might be a stretch goal, but not included in my initial scope. Another good stretch goal would be to have the profile data stored in a cloud native database, but also not included in the original scope.

## Build Requirements
- docker - for docker compose to stand up a jenkins pipeline to perform the builds.

## Deployment Requirements
- Accounts in one or more cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) and access/secret keys to perform automated deployments into these accounts.
